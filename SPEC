Sure! Below is a simple Python program that counts from 1 to 10 and prints each number:

```python
# Program to count from 1 to 10

def count_to_ten():
    for number in range(1, 11):
        print(number)

# Call the function
count_to_ten()
```

You can run this program in any Python environment. It defines a function `count_to_ten` that uses a `for` loop to iterate through numbers 1 to 10 and prints each number. Let me know if you need any modifications or additional features!
